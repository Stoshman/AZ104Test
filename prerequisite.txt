Create the resource groups
When you deploy using ARM templates then the resource groups need to exist prior to the deployment of the templates themselves.

Use the Azure CLI to create five resource groups: VDC-Hub, VDC-Spoke1, VDC-Spoke2, VDC-OnPrem and VDC-NVA . Note that the resource groups must be named exactly as shown here to ensure that the ARM templates deploy correctly.

Highlight the whole of the code block below, and run:

for rg in Hub Spoke1 Spoke2 OnPrem NVA
do az group create --location westeurope --name VDC-$rg
done
Accept the Cisco CSR 1000v Marketplace terms
You will need to accept Ciscoâ€™s Marketplace terms before the ARM template can programmatically deploy the Cisco CSR 1000v into the VDC-NVA resource group. Normally you would do this automatically as part of purchasing the offer in the portal, but as we are provisioning the CSR programatically then we will use these CLI commands to accept the EULA in advance.

Again, copy out all of the following code block and run:

for urn in $(az vm image list --all --publisher cisco --offer cisco-csr-1000v --sku 16_6 --query '[].urn' --output tsv)
do az vm image accept-terms --urn $urn
done
Deploy the ARM template
Once the resource groups have been deployed, you can deploy the main lab environment into these using a set of pre-defined ARM templates.

The templates are available at https://github.com/azurecitadel/vdc-networking-lab if you wish to learn more about how the lab is defined. The templates are also referenced in the https://aka.ms/citadel/arm lab. If you want to create your own programmatic deployments then this workshop is recommended

Essentially, a single master template (DeployVDCwithNVA.json) is used to call a number of other templates, which in turn complete the deployment of virtual networks, virtual machines, load balancers, availability sets and VPN gateways. The templates also deploy a simple Node.js application on the spoke virtual machines, and the Cisco CSR into the VDC-NVA resource group, attached to the two subnets in the hub vNet.

Use the following CLI commands to deploy the template:

master=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azurecitadel/vdc-networking-lab/master/DeployVDCwithNVA.json
az group deployment create --name VDC-Create --resource-group VDC-Hub --template-uri $master --verbose
The template deployment process will take approximately 45 minutes. You can monitor the progress of the deployment from the portal (navigate to the VDC-Hub resource group and click on Deployments at the top of the Overview blade). Alternatively, open up another Cloud Shell session and use the CLI to monitor the template deployment progress as follows:

az group deployment list -g VDC-Hub -o table
Name                                       Timestamp                         State

Once it has completed then you are ready to proceed to the next section of the lab.
